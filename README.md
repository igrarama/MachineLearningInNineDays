# Machine Learning In Nine Days

## Installations
For this mini-course you'll only be needing to install [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section).
Please install the Python 3.x version. 
You do not need to install PyCharm (or any IDE, for that matter) since all exercises will be done in Jupyter notebooks. I recommend you get yourself acquainted with the keyboard shortcuts, it will make your life much easier. 

*Important: when the installation asks if you want to add Anaconda to your PATH, click **yes**. This would make your life easier later. If you already have another version of python installed on your computer, I recommend that you uninstall it first and only then install the Anaconda version, to prevent weird things from happening due to collisions.*

[This](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/gaussians.pdf) and [This](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/more_on_gaussians.pdf) might be useful, but they might be a bit too "mathematical" for our purposes. | |
